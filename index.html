                        The favorite thing about NYU is working environment.
                        You say environment good.Environment, good.Campus also good safety, the place and working between a diverse community is very fair.
                        Like almost everything, you know,because here it's good.
                        Just like the people, the students, the staff. 
                        NYU especially environment is very good.
                        And then especially I like all the studentsbecause all the student is very polite.
                        Not like outside I attend the university before, buthere is all of the student is very polite.
                        And very frankly, that's things I really like.It that's like to work here, because wehave so many culture, so many students fromaround the world, we can meet each otherand then we know something new about them.
                        My favorite thing is every day I'm coming tocampus and I have a new challenges to meet.
                        So every day is a new day for me in this campus.
                        And I enjoyed my work in being at Nyad.
