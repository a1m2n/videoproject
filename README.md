**NYUAD Through the Lens of its Workers**

**Project Description:** 

For this project, we decided to create a video based on option 1 out of the four options we were given for the assignment. This video option aims to tell a story about a specific location and the characters who visit or live there. As a group, the first location that came to our minds was our NYU Abu Dhabi campus. Therefore, we chose this location and decided to tell a story that revolves around it and its community. The video tells the story of non-teaching NYUAD staff and their role in the NYUAD community. Moreover, the video captures their sense of belonging in the campus community through one-on-one interviews with them. The intention of this video is to give the opportunity to these workers to share their personal and valuable views on the NYUAD community and their sense of belonging there. The main concept of this video is to effectively share and draw attention to the contributions of these individuals who work in the shadows to make our campus lively and friendly. The video serves to foster a stronger feeling of gratitude, respect, and understanding for these campus employees who play a significant role in making NYUAD a special place to be a part of. Through this video and website, our goal is to highlight the themes of diversity, inclusion, and belonging.  Immersing the viewers and establishing a connection with the video’s story is the experience we want our audience to achieve. By sharing the voices of these NYUAD employees we strive to create a meaningful, engaging, and thought-provoking experience for our audiences.

**Process:** 

Our first phase of this project was brainstorming and coming up with a concept. We were initially thinking of creating a video revolving around the new restaurant on campus Mysk. However, we were hesitant as we felt there was not a real story to show the viewers. We then came up with the idea of showing NYUAD through the lens of its campus workers. This idea was much more original and shared a meaningful story. Once we settled on this idea, we came up with a short list of questions for our interviewees and potential non-teaching staff to interview. 

Question for Interviews:

-Introducing themselves (What's your name and where are you from?)

-What is your favorite thing about NYUAD?

-What feels like home in NYUAD?

-What's the one thing that creates a sense of belonging to you here at NYUAD?

Potential Interviewees:

-Equipment staff who organize lighting and stages for events

-Public Safety

-D2 Staff

-Marketplace Staff

To implement our concept and video we created a video outline of how many and what types of shots we want to take. The outline can be found [here](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vo_vIGH2nvoln7gAY3-uWRyRk0Y8oZacUkcIobPdmfg/edit?usp=sharing>). The outline consists of a certain structure that we followed for filming in order to remain organized and make sure we are getting all the shots we need. The structure of our video begins with shots of the campus and then clips of the workers introducing themselves one after the other. After we show their responses one by one to the first question and film the atmosphere they are working in. We then follow this for the rest of the questions. The ending section of the video is clips of each interviewee saying “Thank you NYUAD” in their native language. 

**Filming Process:**

To begin our filming process, we decided on what equipment to use. We initially wanted to use the video equipment from the equipment center. After we booked and checked out the equipment we thought using alternative equipment would be more practical for our style of filming for our video concept since it required a lot of movement. Therefore, we decided to use the iPhone 14 Pro cinematic mode for filming. Along with the phone, we used the DJI handheld GIMBAL tripod for filming. The DJI handheld was great to use as it was portable, stable, and kept the frame aligned and balanced. Therefore, it was perfect for shots that required movements and stable for interview shots. For the interview shots, we made sure to follow the guidelines from the class lecture on how to film and have the appropriate shot for an interview (Medium: from waist up & Close-up: face only). The quality of our videos are 4K at 24 fps.

**Permission and Regulations**

A main challenge we faced while filming was getting permission from the workers managers and departments on campus. For D2 workers we had to ask talk to the manager for permission to film and conduct the interviews. However, the manager needed to confirm with his boss first. We also encountered the same issue with interviewing security guards. We were told to first email public safety and ask for permission. After receiving the reply, we were asked to specify our intentions and questions for the interview. Public safety also informed us that we are only allowed to interview security guards when they are off duty in order to avoid compromising campus safety. This ultimately created complications for us and we had to delay filming until we received permission. This also made us resort to different places on campus such as the marketplace. 

**Editing Process:** 

During the editing process, we experienced some challenges. Even though the videos looked great, it was also very high quality and took a lot of power and storage to work with... Before starting to edit the videos we had to go through all the clips and put them in order so they told a story. We made a rough cut of the footage by choosing the best takes of each shot and putting them in an order that made sense. Then, we put transitions between the clips to make the cuts less noticeable and the movie flow better.

We used a mix of fade-ins, fade-outs, and cross-dissolves to make the changes between shots look natural. We also tried out some more creative transitions, like diagonal wipes and zooms, zooms in and out, and mini zooms to make the movie more interesting to look at and give it more variety. Once the rough cut and transitions were done, we started putting effects on the film. We used editing tools for colour correction to change the footage's exposure, contrast, and saturation so that it looked more finished and professional. We also added zooms and pans to some shots and other motion effects to make the movie more interesting to look at.

When it came to sound, we used a separate phone as a professional microphone to record the workers’ answers. To add this sound to the movie, we took the sound from the phone recordings and put it into the editing software. Then, we matched the waveforms and changed the time as needed to get the sound to match the video from the main camera. This lets us use the high-quality audio from the phone recordings instead of the audio from the camera's built-in microphone, which was not as good. The last thing we did was add music to the movie to give it a cinematic and emotional feel. We looked online for royalty-free music and found a song that fit the video's mood and style. Then, we changed the music's volume and timing to fit the pace and subject of the footage.

Overall, it was a lot of work to edit with Adobe Premiere Pro (ESPECIALLY ON PHONE), but we were able to make a movie that looked finished and professional. We learned a lot about the tools and how to use them well, and we're happy with how things turned out in the end.





**Website and Interactivity:** 

In the initial stages of planning, we developed a simple wireframe of how we imagined the website would look and the finished website closely resembles this wireframe. Initial wireframe below:

![](Aspose.Words.c9ceb616-e02a-457c-9a81-6a9aa742f022.001.png) 

Using video.js, we created a video frame with basic video interactive buttons - volume adjustments, maximize, picture-in-picture, and playback speed - to place the video clips in. We also created a textbox next to the video frame that holds the transcript of each video clip. We planned to make the transcript box sync with the video playing but that was taking a lot of time as we needed to create timestamps in the video and link them to the lines in the transcript. We tried generating the stamps and transcripts with tools like youtube automation but that didn’t work quite well with the video.

To create more interactivity aside from the basic video interactions, we created left and right buttons for moving through the different stages of the story and the videos. We also implemented a comment section to allow viewers post their personal responses to the interview questions. The responses are temporarily stored on the web browser’s local storage and are lost if the web page is refreshed.

Aside from the comment section, we included ‘like’ and ‘share’ features. The ‘like’ button keeps track of the number of people who liked the videos on the webpage. Also, the number of likes will be lost when the web page is refreshed.

There are three social media links that a viewer can share the website to: facebook, twitter and linkedin. Clicking these share buttons will redirect the user to the social media pages.

This is a progress bar at the top of every video that keeps track of where you are in the story or the videos you’ve completed and those you have left. The progress bar responds the left and right buttons.

Most of the icons are obtained from font-awesome through the link in the html file.

**Reflection/Evaluation:** 

Through this video project, we were successfully able to execute our concept and idea. On our website, we hosted a video produced by us that revolves around the NYU Abu Dhabi campus and aims to capture the perception of NYUAD workers of the university. Through this video, our goal is to represent the sense of belonging on our campus and promote diversity and inclusion. To achieve these goals, we came across various obstacles starting from obtaining permission to film, to editing, and incorporating it into our website. We wanted to host our video in an engaging and meaningful way that reflects the story and themes of our video. Ultimately, these obstacles were a learning experience that helped us enhance our work and discover new things throughout the process of creation. Therefore, the forms of interactivity we included on the web were carefully thought out to ensure it represents the story and theme in the best way possible while creating an engaging and immersive experience for our users. Nevertheless, we are happy with the concept we have delivered as we are a part of the NYUAD community and it holds great value to each one of us. We are glad it has become a reality and are looking forward to how we can further enhance it.
